# RickAndMorty 

Rick and Morty project, the MVVM architecture was used. A Generic Network Manager was created for network controls. The main page features an interface where characters are listed, and users can click on a character to be
directed to a detail page. On the detail page, there is a button to add characters to favorites,and this action is saved using UserDefaults. On the favorites page, users can view their favorite characters and click on them to navigate back to the detail page. Additionally, characters can be removed from the favorites list if desired.


## Key Features

**Architecture:** MVVM 
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is an architectural design pattern in software development, dividing applications into three key components:
- **Model:** Manages data and business logic, handling data retrieval and storage.
- **View:** Represents the user interface, responsible for displaying data and updating based on changes observed in the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel:** Serves as an intermediary, processing data from the Model for presentation in the View. It contains application logic, handling user inputs and interactions.

**UI:** Programmatic UI, No storyboard
